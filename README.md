[Unrailed AI](https://github.com/Flowtter/unrailed-ai)
[Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu6cn4zaFlU)

However the pre existing AI for this game plays alongside a human and judging (judging done by human who knows little of the game) there is a large skill gap between the human and the AI.

AI trained using only recorded human game-plays, described in Joonas Pussinen's Masters thesis. However, there is a large gap in AI performance and human performance for this game. (https://erepo.uef.fi/handle/123456789/24370)
